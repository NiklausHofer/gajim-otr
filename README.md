gotr
====
gotr is a plugin to enable OTR support in the Gajim XMPP/Jabber client. It
depends on potr (see [python-otr/pure-python-otr](https://github.com/python-otr/pure-python-otr)).

This software is experimental and potentially insecure. Do not rely on it
=========================================================================

Installation
============
Place the `gotr/` direcetory (found in `src/`) in your gajim's `plugins`
directory. This is usually found at one of the following locations:

    $PREFIX/share/gajim/plugins/
    $HOME/.local/share/gajim/plugins/

with $PREFIX being usually `/usr` or `/usr/local`.

After installing, the plugin must be manually enabled in the Gajim plugin
interface.
